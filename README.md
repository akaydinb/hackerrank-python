Solutions of bash exercises in hackerrank

=== What is hackerrank? ===

Hackerrank is a platform, where you can find programming challenges from
easy to hard, in various programming languages. I really like to challenge
myself with such problems. It keeps me on the track. Even if I couldn't
find time to develop a script/program, I like to solve the problems
there just for fun as well as keep my skills sharp. 

The webpage is available at https://www.hackerrank.com/

There are several topics, where you can find challenges specific to that
topic. i.e.

bash (linux shell):  https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/shell \
python:              https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python \
C:                   https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/c \
Math (using python): https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/mathematics


The file names under this repo corresponds to the problem name in that
domain. For example for hackerrank-bash, slice-an-array.sh file is the
solution for the challenge with the same name.

For the repo "hackerrank-python", minion-game.py script is the solution
of the problem "The Minion Game".

... and so on. Some solutions in a specific domain are missing, usually
because the solution of the problem is either too obvious or there is
another very similar problem (and its solution) existing already in the
repo. 

Math challenges are somewhat different than all the rest, as they are
not bonded with a specific programming language. In other words, the 
programmer can freely select the programming language among C, C++, Go,
Java, JS, PHP, Python and many more. I picked up python for these 
challenges for personal reasons, and the solutions are only available
in python. As these are purely algorithmic problems, one can easily
translate the script in another programming language, if the logic
is understood well.
